# Project Description:
The purpose is to show the current service message.

"Everything operates as expected" is the default message. A service operator can set the message manually to something else 
(e.g., "Service checks: No power until 5:00 pm").
A service operator can also reset the message to its default message.

# Technical Details
This Maintenance Monitor works using a REST-based server which uses the Spring Boot version 3.1.0
